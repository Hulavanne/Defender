# Defender
Defender clone


A quick prototype made in a few days in order to showcase my coding style and skillset. As such the execution
of some features may not reflect the way I would have programmed them had this been an actual product,
e.g. the hard coded player controls.


The goals of this little project were to implement:

1) Player controlled ship that can move vertically on the screen
2) Horizontal movement and acceleration of this ship
3) Level should scroll relative to the ship's velocity
4) Level wraps around, is endless
5) Randomly spawning enemies that target the player's ship
6) Enemies shoot projectiles that do damage to the player's ship
7) Touch/mouse and keyboard controls
8) Increasing difficulty
9) Game scoring


How to play?

Move the ship with WASD or arrow keys on the keyboard or use the directional arrows on the screen.
Shoot with left ctrl or by pressing the button in the lower right corner.
The goal is to survive as many waves as possible by shooting the enemies and scoring points while doing so.
When you get hit you must restart the current wave.
After too many hits you die permanently and can then submit your score and start all over again.
