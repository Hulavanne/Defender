A quick prototype made in a few days in order to showcase my coding style and skillset (code found in Assets/Scripts).
The goals of this little project were to implement:

1) A player controlled ship that can move vertically and horizontally (with acceleration) on the screen
2) A level that scrolls relative to the ship's velocity and wraps around seamlessly, is endless
3) Randomly spawning enemies that target the player's ship, shooting at it
4) Touch/mouse and keyboard controls for the player
5) An ever increasing difficulty
6) A scoring system

How to play?

Move the ship with WASD or arrow keys on the keyboard or use the directional arrows on the screen.
Shoot with left ctrl or by pressing the button in the lower right corner.
The goal is to survive as many waves as possible by shooting the enemies and scoring points while doing so.
When you get hit you must restart the current wave.
After too many hits you die permanently and can then submit your score and start all over again.
